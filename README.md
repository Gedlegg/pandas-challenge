# PyCitySchools Analysis

    - In the district summary, key metrics such as the total number of unique schools, students, and budget are calculated alongside average math and reading scores. 

    - Additionally, the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects is calculated and stored in a DataFrame named district_summary. 

    - For the school summary, values inclusing school type, total student count, per capita spending, and average test scores, the number of schools achieving math and reading scores of 70 or higher, as well as those passing both subjects with scores of 70 or higher, are determined and put in the per_school_summary DataFrame.

    - In identifying the highest and lowest performing schools, the analysis sorts schools based on the percentage of overall passing rates, with the top five and bottom five performers, from per_school_summary DataFrames. 

    - Moreover, detailed breakdowns of math and reading scores by grade level are provided, segmented by school and combined into separate DataFrames (math_scores_by_grade and reading_scores_by_grade). 

    - Additionally, the analysis tried to show how scores correlate with spending, school size, and type, with findings summarized and stored in DataFrames spending_summary, size_summary, and type_summary respectively.

    - Finally the analysis is summarized and two conclusions drawn from the the calculations.
